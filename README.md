# Robin Picker

This is a small library to generate a homogeneous list based on a Round-Robin approach.

The complexity for this implementation is O(n*m).

## Running the specs
To run the specs you have to install the dependencies:

`bundle install`

and then

`bundle exec rspec`

Note: The test uses a set of scenarios stored inside `spec/fixtures`
